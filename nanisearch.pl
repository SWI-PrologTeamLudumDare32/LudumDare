% Simple English command listener.  It does some semantic checking
% and allows for various synonyms.  Within a restricted subset of
% English, a command can be phrased many ways.  Also non grammatical
% constructs are understood, for example just giving a room name
% is interpreted as the command to goto that room.

% Some interpretation is based on the situation.  Notice that when
% the player says turn on the light it is ambiguous.  It could mean
% the room light (which can't be turned on in the game) or the
% flash light.  If the player has the flash light it is interpreted
% as flash light, otherwise it is interpreted as room light.

% The grammar doesn't have to be real English.  There are two
% types of commands in Nani Search, those with and without a
% single argument.  A special case is also made for the command
% goto which can be activated by simply giving a room name.

% but there are many synonyms allowed.  For example the command
% turn_on will be triggered by either "turn on" or "switch on".

verb(thing,V) --> tran_verb(V).

nounphrase(Type,Noun) --> det,noun(Type,Noun).
nounphrase(Type,Noun) --> noun(Type,Noun).

det --> [the].
det --> [a].

% Nouns are defined as rooms, or things located somewhere.  We define
% special cases for those things represented in Nani Search by two
% words.  We can't expect the user to type the name in quotes.

noun(thing,'washing machine') --> [washing,machine].
noun(thing,'dirty clothes') --> [dirty,clothes].

% If the player has just typed light, it can be interpreted three ways.
% If a room name is before it, it must be a room light.  If the
% player has the flash light, assume it means the flash light.  Otherwise
% assume it is the room light.
