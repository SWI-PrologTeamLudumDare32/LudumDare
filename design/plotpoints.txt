inner dissent - emphasize the 'agree with my politics' aspect,
as a game mechanic

ideology
method


moral dilemma - hostage taking can be gameplay - some people won't recruit if there's
been too many hostages killed.


resistance as crime - often the most effective resisters



"Look, we know you're new to this command, but the army field manual is very clear on the subject of squad stereotype composition. Every squad must include: 1 quiet religious guy who goes insane, 1 maverick loose cannon who plays by his own rules and dies in a blaze of glory, 1 covert recon opperative with a dark past who at first betrays the team but then has a last minute crisis of conscience and nobly sacrifices himself for the greater good, 1 fresh faced new recruit who survives but loses his innocence and learns to become a man and 3 or 4 other guys who you don't care about so they can get brutally shot so you can show how serious the war is."
—Loading Ready Run makes it official.


the newbie

The leader with a stained past, trying to redeem himself

The femme fatale'

The spunky 'veronique' character

Mata Hari


ragtag bunch of misfits becomes band of true companions

stereotypes:
- the techie guy who supplies stuff
- people with specific skills (tailor, explosives guy)
- the leader
- number two, who has dark secrets that come out when he takes over for the leader
- the scrounger
- the criminal who'se on your side
- the good German
- priests and nuns played against type

Sister Mary Jesus, who taught chemistry and now makes explosives - 


stereotype - commander with no respect for his troops

an incompetent commander might be an interesting character - 

Fun fact: "Neider" in German means "Envier", making Neidermeyer's name a Meaningful Name.

The reluctant resistant - wants to write vitriol filled sheets, but not do anything more meaningful than just pass out propaganda.


tactics:
kidnapping
murder
blackmail
propaganda
sabotage
(check out simple sabotage)

This isn't about us, it's about the whole world!

in a badass crew, everyone gets a moment of awesome.

misfit mobilization - at some point during recruiting, you run into the British agent, who sends you off on missions. You can defer, but of course that doesn't do much for your points.

The sneaky guy is the one in The Team who searches things out, looking for traps, enemies, and other hidden things. If they go first, they sneak and hide, not relying on speed and strength like The Big Guy. They are usually mobile, carrying little equipment. They rely on spotting danger first, stealth, reflexes and their wits to stay alive. They are often stealthy, but the focus can also be on choosing paths thought impossible, being inconspicious, or some other strategy.


some mechanics for player to figure out -

caution new recruits about security - 

don't tell new recruits your name, home address, etc.


mechanic - not obviously useful guy, he'll wave you off of dangerous people

"joe sent me"

communicating while watched (perhaps in jail? in presence of Gestapo?)


misrouting trains

need to attend fancy ball

acheivement - getting warring resistance factions to cooperate.


if you detect the mole you can feed misinformation.

the enemy of my enemy is my friend

have to cooperate with the enemy for short term goals

give the villains a good side

make one resistance faction comic - riddled with internal dissent over trivia like their name, ideology, etc (think monty python skits)

scheme : 
kill a courier. Replace the orders he's carrying with false ones to misdirect the German troops.

steps:
1. Get an informer in the motor pool in <other french city>

you have to have a forger nearby to make the

false flag: the mole says 'listen, I know Pierre - he used to talk about how great a guy Hitler was, how he hated jews, etc. 

false flag: the mole gives you info about a lucretive target. 

choose between the great love and the great cause

before being outed, the team discovers there's a mole. Now they all suspect each other.

Gotta give the player a way to off traitors.  "X is a spy/mole/traitor/etc"
said to sufficiently loyal minion.

the mole becomes sympathetic to the cause.


mask your real goals with a fake goal
strike at enemy's weakness
get a third party to cause damage to enemy
prepare your troops, then get the enemy to rush ill prepared into battle at a time/place of your choosing
loot a burning house - The best time to attack an opponent is when they have their own problems to deal with. Though he who loots a burning house should be careful lest he become trapped inside.

diversions

The general idea is that having fallen for a trick once or twice, an enemy will be unwilling to fall for your trick a third time - so that's when you should actually attack.

the Ks City shuffle - distract the enemy with an obvious deception while using it to conceal the real deception.

Charm and ingratiate yourself with the enemy. Then attack when he's vulnerable.

sacrifice short term objectives to gain long term objectives -
player becomes entangled and must turn in some resistance members to preserve others.

while executing plans, be flexible enough to take advantage of opportunities.

Beat the Grass to Startle the Snake: Do something without aim, but make it so spectacular to provoke a response of the enemy, thereby giving away his plans or position, or just taunt him. Do something unusual, strange, and unexpected as this will arouse the enemy's suspicion and disrupt his thinking. However, an imprudent act will give your position or intentions away to the enemy.

A scam involving a corpse - maybe 'the man who wasn't there' scam.

Lure a high ranking officer into a place he can be killed, by some strategem

 Bait someone by making him believe he gains something or just make him react to it and obtain something valuable from him in return.

Create confusion and use this confusion to further your own goals.
(for us, maybe there are bombing raids, and you can do things you otherwise couldn't)

Disrupt the enemy's formations, interfere with their methods of operations, change the rules which they are used to following, go contrary to their standard training.

To discipline, control, or warn others whose status or position excludes them from direct confrontation; use analogy and innuendo. Without directly naming names, those accused cannot retaliate without revealing their complicity.

Hide behind the mask of a fool, a drunk, or a madman to create confusion about your intentions and motivations.

Lure them onto the Roof, then take away the Ladder: With baits and deceptions, lure your enemy into treacherous terrain, then cut off his lines of communication and avenue of escape; to save himself, he must fight both your own forces and the elements of nature.

 Exchange the roles of Host and Guest: Usurp leadership in a situation where you are normally subordinate. Infiltrate your target. Initially, pretend to be a guest to be accepted, but develop from inside and become the owner later.


The Beauty Trap: Send your enemy beautiful women to cause discord within his camp. This strategy can work on three levels: First, the ruler becomes so enamored with the beauty that he neglects his duties and allows his vigilance to wane; second, other males at court will begin to display aggressive behavior that inflames minor differences hindering co-operation and destroying morale; third, other females at court, motivated by jealousy and envy, begin to plot intrigues, further exacerbating the situation.

Let the Enemy's own spy sow discord in the Enemy camp: Undermine your enemy's intelligence-gathering abilities by using his own spies against him or planting your own agents among his.


 Injure yourself to gain the Enemy's trust: Pretending to be injured has two possible applications. In the first, the enemy is lulled into relaxing his guard since he no longer considers you to be an immediate threat. The second is a way of ingratiating yourself to your enemy by pretending the injury was caused by a mutual enemy.

 Chain Stratagems: In important matters, one should use several stratagems applied simultaneously after another as in a chain of stratagems. Keep different plans operating in an overall scheme; however, in this manner if any one strategy fails, then the chain breaks and the whole scheme fails.

If all else fails, Retreat: The best battle is one fought with your side never having to mobilize, but if it becomes obvious that your current course of action will lead to defeat, then retreat and regroup.

Save the art


Scams 
==================

The fake official - an official is killed on the way to a remo

the spanish prisoner - 

con a german into a compromising position, 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Lustig


the ten commandments of con men
=====================
Be a patient listener (it is this, not fast talking, that gets a con man his coups).
Never look bored.
Wait for the other person to reveal any political opinions, then agree with them.
Let the other person reveal religious views, then have the same ones.
Hint at sex talk, but don't follow it up unless the other person shows a strong interest.
Never discuss illness, unless some special concern is shown.
Never pry into a person's personal circumstances (they'll tell you all eventually).
Never boast - just let your importance be quietly obvious.
Never be untidy.
Never get drunk.

====================
ask for keys to innocuous place,
get handed ring with keys that also has keys to crypto room

good initial sabotage - go into a movie, applaud or talk over the soundtrack
or release a bag of moths

putting time pressure on the mark always helps a con

Report imaginary spies or danger to the Gestapo or police.

===================


<eazar001> but if you put on time pressure ...
<eazar001> like "it will be really quick i promise, you don't have to look through it all"
<eazar001> it expedites things for the con
<eazar001> also having some authority aids the process too
<eazar001> *some*
<eazar001> using lingo is effective.
<eazar001> speaking like a telecom administrator will be much more effeective than "winging it"
<eazar001> you have to know their vocabulary very well.
<eazar001> which is why phone is often used by these people
<eazar001> also asking for "dumb info"
<eazar001> don't ask for authorization codes ... ask for requisition form #
<eazar001> nobody suspects that
<eazar001> use these form #'s to slowly weave your way into questions that will get you slightly more important info
<eazar001> it's like climbing a ladder\
<eazar001> i guess the primary method for some of these guys is to keep educating themselves
<eazar001> asking questions. that's the weapon #1.


<eazar001> nice one ... scotch tape on undeside of manila folder/envelope
<eazar001> put down
<eazar001> leave with stuff
