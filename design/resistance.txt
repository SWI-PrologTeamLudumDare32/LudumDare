Use the 'have to get things from the black marketeer' dodge

papers - perhaps expand on them

people who have been 'compromised' "my daughter, they have her in a camp, they made us do it"

Some people are just flaky

What are the constraints, tactical, and strategic decisions?

an important winning strategy is indirection

Have strategies available for members / OSS agents 'under suspicion'

visible progress - your overall goal is to recruit. All else is secondary.
The first thing you should write is an emotional model 

Factors when deciding to join
 * attitude towards authority, 'Orneriness' - think of how many KS farmers would join despite the risk, just because they have a f-you attitude towards
   authority
 * desire for adventure
 * community vs. family concern
 * Ho Chi Minh's rule - is it better for me?
 * factors making it better to collaborate - 'turn them in for money'
 * factors making it better to resist - 'after the war it will be good for me'.  'at least I'll eat' 
 * ability to compromise this person and make them work for you
 * fear of resistance retaliation
 * desire to be part of a group
 * pride/ego/self esteem   - needs flattery
 * neurotic 'I'm not worthy' if they're over complimented
 * need to not see self as coward
 * 'When the resistance has won, then I'll support them'
 * confidence that the resistance will win
 * trust in honesty - which goes down if you answer inconsistently or say things that make people think you're not honest
 * trust in competency
 * personal attitude - if you insult people they don't like you
 * submission/resistance - apply pressure, this will either make them agree or increase polarization
 * love of France
 * hatred of the nazis, influenced by personal events
 * fear due to past experiences - e.g. someone who'se been approached by gestapo already
 * their politics - communists won't be attracted to degaullists
 * has the contact been developed, or is the approach 'cold'?
 * recruiter is part of a family, work, or other social group 'cell'.


each of these factors must be activated

NPCs ask background questions. if you answer inconsistently they won't trust you after this conversation.

NPC's will sometimes act recruited, then won't be.

Even when people are recruited, they might be flaky, not be competent, or might be compromised

They might be under surveillance

Have a tutorial page that suggests how to recruit, and a 'hints' area that lets you see things you might say.

recruiting is like sales - set them up, then close. But if you close and they're not ready they can go away, or even turn you in.

Tighten the physical surrounding, use a map more like saboteur

Have enough random events that there's replay, but not catastrophic so player feels in control.
