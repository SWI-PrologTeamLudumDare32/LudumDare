match variables
u:  (I _$emotion him)Why do you _0 him?   
stores canonical form,
'_0 is authorial form - careful, that includes number, etc. this also works for patterns
                             'do matches do but not did - did matches only did even without apostrophe

persistant user variables

u: (my name is _~propername)Glad to meet you _0 ($username = _0)

$$foo   temp user variable (lasts to end of volley)

^keep()  do not disable this rule after it produces output

^repeat() even if using multiple rules, 

topic statementcan have keep and/or repeat. This is equivilent to putting keep and/or repeat in
every rule in the topic
topic: ~introductions keep repeat []
adding nostay: By default, if the bot gets a
response from a certain topics, it 'stays' in this topic and gives it priority over other topics.

%input  the id number (starting at 1) of the volley
%userfirstline the id number of the first volley of this conversation

# comments

source ignores line breaks


checking for a new conversation
================================

$pet = _0 $pethwhen = %input
# This means we could write script that can tell if this is a new conversation or not.

s: ($pet $petwhen<%userfirstline) I remember you have a $pet.

Set/concept membership
===========================
concept: ~table_pets (dog cat lion goat elephant)
t: ($pet?~table_pets) Do you ever feed your $pet table scraps during dinner?


general advice
=======================

The bot selects the first line that generates output, prints the output, and stops matching
(conclusion: order your patterns from the more specific to the more general)

a non-canonical form in a pattern, it will match only that exact form, even if we don't use
an apostrophe



things I don't understand
==========

^reuse(FOO)
